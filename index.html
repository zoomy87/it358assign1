              <p>I grew up in a small town called Oblong that is located in southern central Illinois. I

			  Security Controller. After four years I became a Staff Seargent, which is a supervisor. A year

          <div class="subheading mb-3">Java experience</div>
		  <p>As a transfer student my first language was C and when I transfered I took my first Java class. I am fairly
		  comfortable in java and am used to the strict requirements of the languge and enjoy not having to manage memory.
      I am gaining a ton of Java experience while working at State Farm and have learned alot in general. I would rate
    my self a 3 maybe a 4 depending on the project.</p>
		  
		  <div class="subheading mb-3">Database and SQL experience </div>
		  <p>I worked on a college project that made something akin to a LinkedIn clone that used a surprising amount of backend
      and Database work. I've also taken Business Intelligence which used information from the Database to draw conclusions
      and we wrote more SQL and I've taken Database processing. Because of that I have gained a good working knowledge of 
      creating database schemas, relationships,	and writing code to query them. I would rate myself a 4 with databases</p>
		  <div class="subheading mb-3">Leadership</div>	
		  <p>I have gained a wealth of leadership experience though out my life as a Staff Seargent in the Air Force and 
		  at ZF TRW. I enjoy working with people to help them meet their goals and to help a team of people achieve their
		  professional endeavors. One of the best feelings I have is when a group of Airmen I supervised had to make decisions 
		  without me during an exercise. The evaluators took me out to see how they would respond with out a Seargent directing them.
		  They moved as perfectly as could be and stopped the "bad guys".
      </p>
      <div class="subheading mb-3">Web Development</div>	
		  <p>
        While working at State Farm I learned a lot of development and how things are done in the industry for enterprises at least
        for the Spring Framework. I have tinkered with various web based technologies such as angular, wordpress, obviously JSF and 
        Spring, and some others. I would rate myself as a high 3 maybe a 4 depending on the framework.
      </p>
      <div class="subheading mb-3">Mobile Development</div>	
		  <p>
        I have little to no experience developing for a mobile device. So it is easy to give myself a 0 in this area, but I am
        excited to learn and grow in the field.
      </p>
      <div class="subheading mb-3">Cloud Computing</div>	
		  <p>
        I have some experience in this area but not much for me to feel confident about working on any project. That said I have tinkered
        with AWS a little and while at State Farm our application was on their internal cloud storage. I never messed with it but learned
        a little about how they were going to use it for microservices. I would give myself a 1 here.
      </p>
      How do you assess your cloud computing experience, from a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being very proficient? If you have experience in this area (none expected coming into this course), from what course(s) have you learned the materials?

    <h2 class="text-center">Differences between Mobile and Traditional development</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The first difference between these two intrinsicly linked areas of development is the context and user interaction and
      user experience. Here developers and stakeholders make the mistake of trying to mimic the same capabilities that one 
      could get from a desktop. That is a mistake because when a person uses a mobile device their interactions are much quicker,
      and the mobile device has less power to process the data. So if you port your desktop site to a mobile environment many users
      won't even be there when the site actually loads. This links to understanding how important the users' exerperience is. If your
      app is too slow, confusing, or ugly they will move to another becuase in this day in age there is always another app to use. 
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next things to understand are the limitations of a touch based interface and the best practices
        that are associated with each platform. On a mobile device real estate is very limited and button size is important not simply
        a design based on taste. If the button is too small then your user can't click it, and if it's too big then you lose out on 
        the very limited space. One also has to take into consideration button placement because if it is out of reach of the users 
        thumb it makes your app more difficult to use. When following best practices it is ok to put a twist on the app to make it 
        unique, but do so knowing that if it is too different it can be confusing to your user. If you make things look like buttons
        that aren't buttons it can be confusing. So try to stick with the conventions of the platform you are developing for.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The final three things to consider are perceived speed, release cycles, and security of your applications.
        If your app isn't fast then on mobile you will lose the users, which means you have to have a fast app or do you? Turns out you
        don't have to have a fast app simply one that seems fast. What I mean by this if your app is slow then you can add touch states
        to the buttons or unique loading animations. Keeping to the agile development philosophies will go far for mobile development because
        one has to have a short release cycle for updates to your app. Many companies are pushing out product and improving their apps
        and that means you have to  as well. Security is had thing to do because nothing is 100% secure and then we have users that for 
        the most part don't have a first clue about mobile security practices. So when creating your app keep in mind that you have to 
        balance security with accessibility so as you don't annoy or turn off the user.
